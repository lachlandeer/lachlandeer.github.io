## Motivation

Digital and Social Media Strategies introduces students to the fundamentals of the digital marketplace. 
The class is designed to familiarize students with the most important aspects of
the main types of digital markets. 
Within each market we encounter, students will be introduced to the types of strategic questions marketers are working to answer and learn an analytics toolkit that they can employ to deliver the quantitative answers to inform strategic decision making.
The approach of decision driven analytics taught in this class puts students at the forefront of how leading scholars' and employers' approach digital marketing, with a toolkit that can be utilized in future academic study, and when working in the private sector at firms of any size and scope.
