abstract: " National public health awareness campaigns that emphasize peer-to-peer support are being increasingly adopted, but evidence on the effect of peer-based programs at scale is limited. Using quasi-experimental methods, we examine whether the prominent, nationwide R U OK? Day campaign affects short-term mental health outcomes in Australia.  Leveraging detailed data, we find R U OK? Day leads to a 4% of a standard deviation increase in self-reported mental wellbeing, with the effect particularly pronounced among middle-aged males who experience a 9% of a standard deviation increase.  However, we find no effects on mental health care utilization or suicide rates. Our results underscore that although peer-based campaigns can improve mental wellbeing, especially for high-risk groups, the challenge of realizing tangible broader public health impact may require complementary strategies.
