abstract: "The open science paradigm has gained prominence in marketing as researchers seek to enhance the validity, reliability, and transparency of research methods and findings. Journals and institutions increasingly encourage or require open science practices, and many authors have started to adapt to and meet these new research and publishing expectations. We provide guidance for effectively implementing open science practices in empirical marketing research. Our recommendations, are tailored to the unique methodological approaches and challenges of each subdiscipline and their specific research contexts. Successful integration of these practices into academic marketing research will require concerted and collaborative efforts among authors, journals, institutions, and funding agencies. We argue that the gradual, thoughtful adoption of these principles and practices will improve the quality and efficiency of scientific discovery.."
